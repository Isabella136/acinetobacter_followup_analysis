# acinetobacter_followup_analysis

Reimplementing analysis from [Javkar et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.714284/full#h13) with some twists

Goals of this reimplementation:
- Replicate the analysis presented in the paper and compare my output with the reported results
- Extend lineage estimation to all isolates
- Compare extended lineage with phenotype results for all isolates
- Compare MLST results with phenotype results for all isolates
- Include ceftazidime, pip/tazo, gentamicin, imipenem, amikacin, amp/sulbactam, trimeth/sulfa, ciprofloxacin, cefepime in phenotype results
